NP-Completeness.py, SAT to 3SAT and verify.

Since my student number is end with 8, so I use:

F = (¬q1 v ¬q2) ∧ (q1 v q2 v ¬q3 v q4 v ¬q5) ∧ (¬q2)

```bash
$ python NP-Completeness.py
```

main.py

Since my surname is start with "M", so I use inst-e.tsp and inst-f.tsp

```bash
python main.py inst-f.tsp 10 100 100 1 0.9 0.05
```
